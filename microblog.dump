INSERT INTO section_grid VALUES(7,4,'two-thirds',1,'','I got my start in professional coding with VBA: Microsoft''s Visual Basic for Applications. It comes with all the Office products, but I''ve mostly used it with Excel and Access. At this point I''ve been using VBA for over a year, and I''ve gotten pretty handy with it.

In Excel, I''ve used VBA to automate saving data from custom userforms to spreadsheets, auto-filling and printing forms, doing advanced data validation, and more. Most of the office I work at now is using at least one of my automated forms.

I''ve also created a few handy Excel user-defined functions and macros, which I''ve packaged as an add-in. It allows you to hit Ctrl-Shift-C to copy just the text from a cell, and Ctrl-Shift-V to paste without formatting. It also adds two few workbook functions, which you can use to generate random names and randomly assign cells to a number of people (for an audit, say).

While this site is my single biggest project, I''ve also put together a handy password generator using JavaScript. It''s called sitePass, and it generates passwords by using a secure one-way hash of a website''s name and a password. That lets you generate strong passwords for each of your (many) logins, while only having to remember one. And since it uses a one-way hash, if an attacker gets their hands on one of your passwords, they can''t use it to get the rest. Useful!

It''s free to use, check it out <a href=''/sitePass''>here!</a>','','');
